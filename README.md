## Data collection camera mounts

The upstream [Camera-Mount repository](https://github.com/xiehuangbao888/Camera-Mount) supplies four numbered mounts and four associated adapter parts. The associations below are translated from the original filenames. Upstream does not include assembly instructions or photographs; completed assemblies and camera compatibility have not been verified.

### Mount 1

![CAD preview: mount-1](images/mount-1.png)

*mount-1: preview rendered from the supplied STEP file.*

![CAD preview: mount-1-rebot-adapter](images/mount-1-rebot-adapter.png)

![CAD preview: mount-1-soarm-adapter](images/mount-1-soarm-adapter.png)

*mount-1-soarm-adapter: preview rendered from the supplied STEP file.*

[Download mount-1.stp](data-collection-camera-mounts/mount-1.stp)

Camera mount design 1 has a tall, tapered support body with a stepped upper interface. Two separate adapter variants are supplied:

- [reBot adapter](data-collection-camera-mounts/mount-1-rebot-adapter.stp): a plate-shaped insert with an opening and an offset attachment section, named “mount 1 rebot insert” upstream.
- [SO-ARM adapter](data-collection-camera-mounts/mount-1-soarm-adapter.stp): an offset plate-shaped insert, named “mount 1 soarm insert” upstream.

Select the adapter corresponding to your setup and inspect the interface in CAD. The previews above show the mount and each adapter as separate CAD parts.

### Mount 2

![CAD preview: mount-2](images/mount-2.png)

*mount-2: preview rendered from the supplied STEP file.*

![CAD preview: mount-2-soarm-adapter](images/mount-2-soarm-adapter.png)

*mount-2-soarm-adapter: preview rendered from the supplied STEP file.*

[Download mount-2.stp](data-collection-camera-mounts/mount-2.stp)

Camera mount design 2 has a tapered support body with a different upper interface from design 1. A separate [SO-ARM adapter](data-collection-camera-mounts/mount-2-soarm-adapter.stp) is supplied, identified upstream as the mount 2 soarm insert. Inspect the two models together to determine how they connect. The previews above show the mount and its adapter as separate CAD parts.

### Mount 3

![CAD preview: mount-3](images/mount-3.png)

*mount-3: preview rendered from the supplied STEP file.*

![CAD preview: mount-3-4-adapter](images/mount-3-4-adapter.png)

*mount-3-4-adapter: preview rendered from the supplied STEP file.*

[Download mount-3.stp](data-collection-camera-mounts/mount-3.stp)

Camera mount design 3 has a tapered support body and a rectangular raised section at the top. The [mount 3 / 4 adapter](data-collection-camera-mounts/mount-3-4-adapter.stp) is identified by its upstream filename as the shared insert for designs 3 and 4. The previews above show this mount and the shared adapter as separate CAD parts.

### Mount 4

![CAD preview: mount-4](images/mount-4.png)

*mount-4: preview rendered from the supplied STEP file.*

[Download mount-4.stp](data-collection-camera-mounts/mount-4.stp)

Camera mount design 4 has a tapered support body with a broad, recessed top interface. Its associated part is the same [mount 3 / 4 adapter](data-collection-camera-mounts/mount-3-4-adapter.stp). Inspect the CAD geometry to compare designs 3 and 4 before choosing one. The preview above shows the supplied CAD part.

### Original-to-English filename mapping

Only filenames have changed; the CAD file contents are preserved. Mount numbers and adapter associations remain traceable to upstream.

| --- | --- |
| `数据采集摄像头支架_支架1.stp` | [`mount-1.stp`](data-collection-camera-mounts/mount-1.stp) |
| `数据采集摄像头支架_支架1插件rebot.stp` | [`mount-1-rebot-adapter.stp`](data-collection-camera-mounts/mount-1-rebot-adapter.stp) |
| `数据采集摄像头支架_支架1插件soarm.stp` | [`mount-1-soarm-adapter.stp`](data-collection-camera-mounts/mount-1-soarm-adapter.stp) |
| `数据采集摄像头支架_支架2.stp` | [`mount-2.stp`](data-collection-camera-mounts/mount-2.stp) |

## Data collection environment

![Box environment model preview](images/box.png)

*Box: preview rendered from mesh geometry in the supplied USDZ file.*

[Download box.usdz](data-collection-environment/box.usdz)

A box model from [rebot-arm-dli-isaacsim](https://github.com/yuyoujiang/rebot-arm-dli-isaacsim), supplied as a USDZ asset for a data collection environment. This is an environment model rather than a camera mount. Open it in a USDZ-compatible viewer to inspect its geometry; no physical build photograph is supplied.

## Working with the files

1. Download the mount and any associated adapter using the links above.
2. Open STEP/STP files in a CAD tool and inspect dimensions, clearances, and mounting holes.
3. Prepare fabrication files for your chosen process. STL files, print settings, and a hardware bill of materials are not included.
4. For the environment asset, use a viewer or tool that supports USDZ.

## Image sources and model previews

Every model file has a preview rendered directly from its source STEP or USDZ geometry. These are model previews, not physical-product photographs. Adapter parts are shown separately; the images do not imply verified assembly or fit.

Two additional B601 reference images come from upstream: [D405.jpg](https://github.com/Seeed-Projects/reBot-DevArm/blob/main/hardware/reBot_B601_DM/3D_Printed_Parts/images/D405.jpg) and [D435i.jpg](https://github.com/Seeed-Projects/reBot-DevArm/blob/main/hardware/reBot_B601_DM/3D_Printed_Parts/images/D435i.jpg). Both are CAD renderings.

To regenerate the previews, install `cadquery`, `matplotlib`, `numpy`, and `usd-core` in a Python environment, then run `python tools/render_previews.py` from the repository root.
